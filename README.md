## Description:

Our objective is to redevelop HAGRID in SPARK, a subset of the Ada
programming language targeted at formal verification, and to prove the
following properties about the code:

 - absence of runtime errors
 - correct data and information flows
 - functional correctness
 - security (privacy?) properties that can be encoded in data/control contracts

We also plan to evaluate the efficiency of the executable code to
compare it with the original implementation in Rust, and to
demonstrate its usability on a variety of hardware platforms.

## Collaborations:

We are interested in collaborating on the best approach to achieve the
above goals, either with people willing to contribute to the
project directly, or with people sharing the same overall goals
with other languages and tools.
