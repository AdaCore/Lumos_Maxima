# Lumos Maxima

This project is a solution in SPARK for the [VerifyThis Collaborative Long-term
Verification Challenge](https://verifythis.github.io/).

## Goal

Our objective is to redevelop HAGRID in
[SPARK](https://github.com/AdaCore/spark2014/), a subset of the Ada programming
language dedicated to formal verification, and to prove the following
properties about the code:

- absence of runtime errors
- correct data and information flows
- functional correctness
- security (privacy?) properties that can be encoded in data/control contracts

We also plan to evaluate the efficiency of the executable code to compare it
with the original implementation in Rust, and to demonstrate its usability on a
variety of hardware platforms.
