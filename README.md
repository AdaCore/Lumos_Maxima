# Lumos Maxima
This is the repository of the *Lumos Maxima* team participating to the [VerifyThis 2020 Collaborative Long-term Verification Challenge](https://verifythis.github.io/)

## Contacts:
[Yannick Moy](mailto:"<lastname>@adacore.com") and [Claude Marché](mailto:"<firstname>.<lastname>@inria.fr")

## Participants:
Claude Marché, Sylvain Dailler, Johannes Kanig, Claire Dross, Yannick Moy

## Webpage(s):
[GitHub project](https://github.com/AdaCore/Lumos_Maxima)

## Description:

The repository contains a toy implementation in SPARK (a subset of the Ada
programming language targeted at formal verification) of a key server, similar
to HAGRID. We proved the following properties of the core functionality of the
code:

 - absence of runtime errors
 - correct data and information flows
 - functional correctness
 - termination

## Collaborations:

We are interested in collaborating on the best approach to achieve the
above goals, either with people willing to contribute to the
project directly, or with people sharing the same overall goals
with other languages and tools.
